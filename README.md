# Uber-Analysis
Uber data analysis with various aspects.


**Introduction:**
  This data set is a masked data set which is similar to what data analysts at Uber handle. Solving
  this assignment will give you an idea about how problems are systematically solved using EDA
  and data visualisation.

**Business Objectives**
  The aim of analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and
  non-availability of cars) and recommend ways to improve the situation. As a result of your
  analysis, you should be able to present to the client the root cause(s) and possible hypotheses
  of the problem(s) and recommend ways to improve them.

The code is written in a Jupyter Notebook with a Python 2.7 kernel, and in addition it requires the following packages:

  Pandas (version: 0.19.2)
  
  Matplotlib (version: 1.5.3)
  
  Seaborn (version: 0.6.0)
